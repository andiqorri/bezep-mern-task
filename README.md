# MERN To-Do List App - Intern Task
Welcome, interns! This project is designed to test your skills in developing a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack application. You will be working on a To-Do List app, where you'll need to implement both backend (server) and frontend (client) functionalities. Before you begin, make sure you have Docker installed on your system. If you don't have it, you can download it from Docker's official website.

To begin working on this project, first, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/petritluta/bezep-mern-task.git
```

## Project Overview
The project structure consists of two folders: `server` (backend) and `client` (frontend). The backend is a Node.js Express.js API responsible for handling CRUD operations on lists and tasks. The frontend is built using React and will provide a user interface to interact with the backend API.

## Setup
1. Make sure you have Docker installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
4. Run the following command to start the development environment:
```
docker-compose up
```
This will set up the backend and frontend environments, along with the necessary dependencies.

## Backend Task
In the `server` folder, you will find a basic structure for the backend API. Your task is to complete the following:

1. Finish the controllers for lists and tasks.
2. Implement CRUD operations for lists and tasks.
3. Implement data validation for incoming data. You can use any third-party library you prefer.
4. Optionally, you can implement pagination for lists and tasks (bonus points).

Feel free to structure the code as you see fit and use any best practices you are aware of.

## Frontend Task
In the `client` folder, you will find the basic structure of the frontend React application. Your task is to complete the following:

1. Design the UI for the HomePage and ListDetailPage. You have the freedom to express your creativity in designing the components and layout.
2. Implement data fetching from the backend API for displaying active lists on the HomePage.
3. Provide a button on the HomePage to open a dialog for creating a new list.
4. Each list row on the HomePage should contain an icon to delete the list.
5. Implement data fetching and updating functionality for tasks within a list on the ListDetailPage.
6. Use built-in React hooks like useState, useEffect, etc., for managing state and side effects.
7. Implement frontend data validation (You can use any third-party library you prefer).

## Bonus Points
You can earn bonus points by implementing the following:

1. Pagination in  the backend.
2. Any additional features or improvements to enhance the user experience.

## Penalties

As an intern working on this project, it is essential to maintain the integrity of your work and demonstrate your skills authentically. Therefore, the following actions are strictly prohibited:

1. **Copying Pre-made Solutions:** You must not copy and paste any pre-existing code solutions from external sources or previous projects. Your work should be original, and you should actively develop the solutions on your own.

2. **Using Code Generation Tools or AI Models:** Utilizing code generation tools, automated code-writing AI models like Chat GPT, or any other similar technology to produce code is strictly forbidden. Your code should be the result of your own efforts and knowledge.

Failure to adhere to these guidelines will result in appropriate penalties, which may include disqualification from the internship program.

We want to assess your skills and abilities genuinely, and we encourage you to learn, explore, and tackle the tasks independently. This will not only help you grow as a developer but also enable us to evaluate your potential for future opportunities. If you encounter any challenges during the project, feel free to seek clarification and guidance from the provided resources or ask questions. We are here to support your learning and development throughout the internship.

## Submission
Once you have completed the tasks, zip the entire project folder (excluding the `node_modules` directories) and send it to the provided email address.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need clarifications. Happy coding, and we look forward to seeing your work!

## Don't Get Discouraged

As you embark on this internship task, we want to emphasize that we value your effort and determination more than the final outcome. We understand that software development can be challenging, and the learning process may involve facing difficulties and obstacles.

If you find yourself struggling to complete all aspects of the task or encounter technical roadblocks, please remember the following:

1. **Learning Opportunity:** This task is designed not only to assess your current skills but also to provide you with valuable learning experiences. Don't be afraid to explore new concepts, experiment with different approaches, and ask questions.

2. **Ask for Help:** If you encounter any difficulties or have questions related to the task, feel free to seek assistance. Our team is here to support you, and we encourage you to reach out for guidance whenever needed.

3. **Effort Matters:** While completing the task is essential, what matters most to us is the effort you put into it. Demonstrating a willingness to learn, a proactive attitude, and a passion for problem-solving is highly valued.

4. **Learning Takes Time:** Rome wasn't built in a day, and becoming a proficient developer takes time. It's okay to encounter challenges and take incremental steps towards improvement.

5. **Feedback and Growth:** Even if you couldn't fully implement all the features or meet all the requirements, we will provide constructive feedback on your work. This feedback will be invaluable in your growth as a developer.

We encourage you to submit your work, even if it is not fully finished. The submission will give us insight into your thought process, problem-solving skills, and areas where you may need additional support. We value the effort you invest in this task, and it will provide a strong foundation for us to guide you further in your development journey.

Remember that every great developer was once a beginner, and continuous learning and perseverance are the keys to success. We appreciate the effort you invest in this task and the dedication you show to improving your skills. Keep pushing yourself, and don't hesitate to learn from both your successes and mistakes.

If you put in your best effort and demonstrate a genuine interest in learning, that will speak volumes about your potential as a developer. We are excited to see your progress and support you throughout this journey. Good luck, and enjoy the learning process!
